scikit-ferm documentation
=========================================

**scikit-ferm** is a Python package designed to be a toolkit, when working with fermentation data. Whether you're studying food fermentation (like yogurt production) or simulating microbial behavior for research and development, scikit-ferm provides flexible tools to simulate, process and learn.

Based on the `scikit-learn <https://scikit-learn.org/>`_ API and `pandas <https://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ API, scikit-ferm is designed to be easy to use and integrate with other Python packages. It's also built with extensibility in mind, so you can easily add new models and datasets to suit your needs.
