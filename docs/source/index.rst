Welcome to the scikit-ferm documentation!
=========================================

**scikit-ferm** is a Python package designed to generate synthetic fermentation datasets and model microbial growth dynamics. Whether you're studying food fermentation (like yogurt production) or simulating microbial behavior for research and development, scikit-ferm provides flexible tools to create realistic datasets based on established growth models.

Based on the `scikit-learn <https://https://scikit-learn.org//>`_ API, scikit-ferm is designed to be easy to use and integrate with other Python packages. It's also built with extensibility in mind, so you can easily add new models and datasets to suit your needs.
